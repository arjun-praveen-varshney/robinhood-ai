## Implementation Details

### AI Stock Predictor

The AI Stock Predictor uses a pre-trained LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model implemented with TensorFlow.js to analyze historical stock data and predict future price movements. The model considers factors such as:

- Historical price patterns
- Trading volume
- Market trends
- Technical indicators

Each prediction comes with a confidence score that indicates the model's certainty in its forecast.

### Virtual Trading Simulator

The Virtual Trading Simulator allows users to practice trading with $10,000 in virtual cash. Key features include:

- Real-time buy/sell orders
- Portfolio tracking
- Performance metrics
- Leaderboard competition

## Hackathon Submission
